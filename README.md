# Node.js Mentorship Program

Learning how to work with people to whom you don’t have a natural connection, demonstrating patience with those in need of guidance and support, helping people figure out the best path forward: all trademarks of a great leader AND skills honed through mentoring.  The more you work at leadership on a one-to-one basis, the more you’ll improve in larger group settings.
